          I am a counsellor offering a warm, reflective, and collaborative space
          for people who want to understand themselves more deeply and find new
          ways of being with their experiences.

        <h2>How I work</h2>
        <p>
          I offer a warm, attentive relationship where we can work together with the difficulties you bring. Many people come to therapy because something isn't working in their life, or because they feel stuck in ways they cannot shift on their own. I take these concerns seriously and see therapy as a place where real change can happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our work is shaped by your needs and what you are hoping for. Some people arrive wanting help with a specific problem; others come with a more general sense that something needs to change. Together, we take time to understand what is happening for you, and how past experiences, relationships, and different parts of yourself may be involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Change often happens through developing a different relationship with yourself — with your thoughts, emotions, and history — and through experiencing a reliable, responsive relationship in the present. As we work together, patterns that once felt fixed or overwhelming can begin to shift, making room for new ways of responding and living.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach is collaborative. I do not see myself as the expert on your life, but I do bring my training, experience, and attention to the work. We think, reflect, and move forward together, at a pace that feels both safe and meaningful. Over time, this can lead to greater clarity, relief from distress, and a stronger sense of choice in how you meet life's challenges.
        </p>

        <h3>Areas I work with</h3>
        <p>
          I work with adults who are seeking help with a range of difficulties, including:
        </p>
        <ul class="work-areas">
          <li>Anxiety and low mood</li>
          <li>Loss, grief, and bereavement</li>
          <li>Relationship and attachment difficulties</li>
          <li>Feeling stuck or uncertain</li>
          <li>Trauma (childhood and adult)</li>
          <li>Dissociation</li>
          <li>Anger and unresolved emotional conflict</li>
          <li>Experiences of bullying or marginalisation</li>
          <li>Shame, self-criticism, and low self-worth</li>
          <li>Life transitions and identity questions</li>
          <li>Work-related stress and dissatisfaction</li>
          <li>The impact of sexual, physical, or emotional abuse</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You do not need to be certain about what you want to work on in order to begin. Therapy can be a place to find that out together.
        </p>

        <h3>My background</h3>
        <p>
          I began my own personal development journey in 2016, and over the past ten years this has shaped both my personal and professional life. This ongoing work informs how I understand change — as something that develops through attention, relationship, and time, rather than quick solutions alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside my clinical training, I bring experience from earlier professional work outside psychotherapy, which supports my understanding of the pressures people face in work, relationships, and identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am fully insured to practise and am registered with the UKCP (UK Council for Psychotherapy) and the BACP (British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy). I work in accordance with their ethical frameworks, attend regular supervision, engage in ongoing Continuing Professional Development (CPD), and hold registration with the CID in relation to data protection and confidentiality.

          <h3>How do you work?</h3>
          <p>
            I aim to offer a warm, attentive relationship where you can feel met with respect and care. I work in a way that is relational and person-centred, with room for depth, reflection, and meaning. Rather than following a set programme, I stay close to what you bring and how you experience things, trusting that understanding and change grow through being listened to carefully and taken seriously.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item" id="faq-frequency">
          <h3>How often will I need to come to therapy?</h3>
          <p>
            Most people come once a week, as regular sessions help create a sense of continuity and safety. At times, meeting more frequently can be helpful, and this is something we would talk about together. We can review the rhythm of our work as things unfold, rather than fixing it rigidly in advance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item" id="faq-session">
          <h3>What happens in a psychotherapy session?</h3>
          <p>
            Sessions take place in a quiet, confidential space where we sit and talk together. You might bring current concerns, relationships, memories, or feelings that feel difficult to hold on your own. There is no pressure to talk in a particular way or to reach conclusions. Often, change begins by gently staying with what feels unclear, painful, or unfinished, and allowing it to be understood more fully.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item" id="faq-regulated">
          <h3>Are you regulated by a professional body?</h3>
          <p>
            I am registered with both the UKCP (UK Council for Psychotherapy) and the BACP, and I work in line with their ethical frameworks. This includes commitments to confidentiality, professional boundaries, supervision, and ongoing learning. I am also registered with the CID in relation to data protection and confidentiality.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item" id="faq-personal">
          <h3>Are you in personal therapy yourself?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. I see personal therapy as an important part of my professional life. It supports my capacity to reflect, to remain open and grounded, and to stay attentive to the impact of the work on both myself and my clients.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item" id="faq-supervision">
          <h3>What supervision do you undertake?</h3>
          <p>
            I attend regular clinical supervision on a fortnightly basis. Supervision provides a confidential and reflective space to think carefully about my work and to ensure that I am practising safely, ethically, and with care.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item" id="faq-cpd">
          <h3>How do you maintain your professional development?</h3>
          <p>
            I engage in ongoing Continuing Professional Development (CPD) as part of my commitment to reflective and ethical practice. This helps me stay connected to current thinking and to continue developing my work as a therapist.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item" id="faq-cancellation">
          <h3>Do you have a cancellation policy?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. I ask for one week's notice for cancellations or changes to sessions. Regularity and reliability are an important part of creating a safe therapeutic space, and this policy helps support that.
